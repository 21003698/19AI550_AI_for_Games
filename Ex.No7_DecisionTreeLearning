REGISTER NUMBER :
AIM:
Design a decision tree for following data. 
Data: [Health, Cover, Ammo, Exposed]
# Health: 1 for Healthy, 0 for Hurt
# Cover: 1 for In Cover, 0 for Exposed
# Ammo: 1 for With Ammo, 0 for Empty
# Exposed: 1 for Exposed, 0 for In Cover
# Actions: 0 for Defend, 1 for Attack
Algorithm:
1. Start the program
2. import the necessary packages 
3. Design a training data and test data 
4. Create a decision tree classifier model
5. Output the predictions 
6. Visualize the decision tree 
Program:






Output:



Result:
Thus the optimum value of max player was found using minimax search.
